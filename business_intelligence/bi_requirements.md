# 📈 Business Intelligence Requirements

## Objective
To transition farm management from reactive intervention (fixing problems after they occur) to proactive strategy based on real-time data from the scheduling, inventory, and weather modules.

## Key Requirements Supported:
1.  **Risk Mitigation:** The Audit & Compliance Dashboard must immediately highlight all attempts to bypass the Phase VII security rule.
2.  **Resource Optimization:** Managers require a ranking system (Resource Efficiency Rank) to drive decisions on material allocation.
3.  **Predictive Insight:** The Weather Volatility Index must provide an early warning metric for high-risk planting periods.
4.  **PL/SQL Performance Monitoring:** The Performance Dashboard must display the execution time of key procedures (e.g., `PRC_COMPLETE_TASK`) to identify bottlenecks.
